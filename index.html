        <p class="intro">
          Sass uses CSS-compatible, indented syntax to provide customized,
          well-formatted output. It uses indentation rather than brackets to
          indicate nesting of selectors, and new lines rather than semicolons to
          separate properties. Sass employs language extensions such as
          variables, nested rules, and mixins, my next article will briefly give
          an Overview of CSS Preprocessing . Especially applicable to effective
          design, Sass contains useful functions for manipulating colors and
          other values on your web page. Files using this syntax have the .Sass
          extension.
